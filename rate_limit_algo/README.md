# Rate Limiting concept in node js (practical)

## API Rate Limiting

API rate limiting is a set of measures put in place to help ensure the stability and performance of an API system. It works by setting limits on how many requests can be made within a certain period of time — usually a few seconds or minutes — and what actions can be taken.

If too many requests are made over that period, the API system will return an error message telling you that the rate limit has been exceeded.
